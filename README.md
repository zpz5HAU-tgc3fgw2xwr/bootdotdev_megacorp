# 🏢 MegaCorp (Git Testing)

This repository contains the **MegaCorp** project, part of the [Boot.dev course on Git](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-git-2). This project focuses on exploring and practicing Git commands, workflows, and collaboration strategies in a simulated corporate environment.

## 🚀 Features

- **Git Basics**: Practice essential commands like `clone`, `commit`, `push`, and `pull`.
- **Branching and Merging**: Work with branches to manage parallel development workflows.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Learn strategies to resolve merge conflicts effectively.
- **Rebase and Squash**: Optimize commit history for cleaner and more readable logs.
- **Simulated Team Collaboration**: Work with multiple branches and contributors.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Git**: Version control for source code management.
- **Command Line**: Execute Git commands via terminal.
- **GitHub**: Host and collaborate on repositories.

## 📚 What I Learned

- Managing feature branches and merging them into the main branch.
- Resolving merge conflicts during collaboration.
- Using `rebase` to keep a clean commit history.
- Leveraging GitHub features like pull requests and branch protection rules.

## 🧪 Testing

This project mainly involved testing and practicing Git workflows. Key practices included:

- Experimenting with branch creation and deletion.
- Simulating collaborative workflows to encounter and resolve merge conflicts.
- Practicing rewriting commit history with `rebase` and `amend`.

## 🌟 Why This Project?

The MegaCorp project is designed to solidify Git skills, including:

- Navigating and resolving real-world Git challenges.
- Understanding how to maintain clean and readable commit histories.
- Learning best practices for collaborative software development.
